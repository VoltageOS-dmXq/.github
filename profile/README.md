# Voltage OS for **dmXq** (Galaxy S23 Series)

Welcome to the **Voltage OS** hub for Samsungâ€™s Galaxy S23 family (codename *dmXq*).  
Our goal is simple: deliver a fast, privacy-respecting, developer-friendly Android ROM that sticks close to vanilla AOSP while adding the thoughtful tweaks power users crave.
